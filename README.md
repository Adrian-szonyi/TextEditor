## Description

This is a simple text editor application that uses both client and server side logic to store user inputs. This uses the integrated database in the browser to store any text and a service worker is enabled so that the text remains even when the page is closed. The application is hosted on heroku and was optimised using webpack config.


## Installation

The application is hosted on Heroku, you can go to the link here:
There is also an install button on the site for offline use. If you install it to your browser the text editor application will be available offline and easily accesible without having to remember the link.

## Tests

You can test the functionality using the Chrome Browser dev tools or running Jest npm tests.
